# mbti_test

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

This project is a work with the first team conducted in the Sniper Factory Flutter training course.

It was written for the purpose of producing mbti tests in flutter, and the main language is dart.
We implemented the algorithm based on the paper below.
